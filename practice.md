<p>I am very new to Cloud Computing. I myself find difficult to make the required services up and running and stopping the services after the use and always skeptical about the data security</p> 
<p>I would like to choose Amazon S3 as my topic as it can help me research on how to work on cloud and I will mention a detailed approach on how to use Amazon S3 securely and may be a little on how to overcome the challenges with data security as a beginner</p>
<p>Amazon S3 provides a storage management and administration capability that is highly flexible.
S3 provides various data protection requirements which helps application owners keep their data secure at all times. But does everyone know?

</p>

<p>Although s3 has been across the most vulnerable AWS service due to misconfiguration by the application owners, 
if configured as per security best practices, S3 can be used as a most reliable data lake because it can be easily integrated with data analytic tools (Ex: Athena, quick sight). I am planning to explore this part of S3 how our bigdata can be securely maintained.
